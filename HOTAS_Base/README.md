This is not finished yet if you are interessted watch out for further commits...
This code should be in a usable state until the end of January if everything goes as planed but it will probably be mid-end of february.

Also follow this project on my other sites for the 3D-Modells and PCB etc.
If here is still no link then im sorry, i will probably post it in the near future. :)

This code is built on different Libraries, use it at your own risk.
I have created this not for comercial use only as a proof of concept.
Any further risk taken is at your own risk.

THis project is build upon the Arduino framework, in VisualStudioCode, with the PlatformIO extension

ÂµC that are usable for this are all arduinos with a 32u4 processors and also with some hacking the 16u2s

note:
This project was build on an Ardunio Micro 32u4, so if you wanna copy and past this project than modify the .pio files or adjust your hardware...
